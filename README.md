project 3

I am in need of an estimate calculator at work for providing estimates for RFPs.
Based on the type of work, maintenance or development, by year, we need to provide estimates for each testing program and testing subject.
The hourly rates are different by resource type. The corresponding names of the resources are also provided in the estimates, to forecast the budgets for the year.
